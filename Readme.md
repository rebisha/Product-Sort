## Product Filter

This is a React application that displays a list of shirts from the json data. The application also provides the user an option to filter the products on the basis of sizes and sort the products based on the price i.e Low to High and vice-versa.

Once you either clone the project or download the zip file, go inside the folder (`Product-Sort`) and run `npm install` in the cmd.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080/] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
